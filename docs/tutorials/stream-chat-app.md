# Streaming chat application

We're going to build a chatGPT like chat application with `@axflow/models`, leveraging the `useChat` react hook. Importantly, it will stream results back to the user, to improve the user experience of the typical high latency LLM API calls.

We'll be using `@axflow/models`, TypeScript, tailwindCSS, React, nextJS, and openAI.

If you want to see the full code of this demo, you can find [here on GitHub](https://github.com/axflow/axchat-demo).

## Setup

First, let's create a new nextJS project with TypeScript & Tailwind:

```
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --tailwind axchat
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … *No* / Yes
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? … *No* / Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … No / *Yes*
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? … *No* / Yes
Creating a new Next.js app in /Users/nicholascharriere/axilla/axchat.
```

Second, let's install the models package:

```
npm install @axflow/models
```

Finally, we'll need to add the openAI API key to our `.env.local` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-123...
```

## Scaffolding

Before we make anything work, let's get the scaffolding of our client ready. We'll be using the default `app/page.tsx` as our main route and 2 other components:

- `app/form.tsx` will hold the input box for the user, and the submit button to send each message
- `app/chat-box.tsx` will be exactly what it sounds like.

Let's create the skeleton for each file:

```tsx
// app/form.tsx
export default function Form() {
  return <div>Form</div>;
}
```

```tsx
// app/chat-box.tsx
export default function ChatBox() {
  return <div>Chat box</div>;
}
```

Now, let's clean up all the default nextJS content in `app/page.tsx`, and add our basic scaffold:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx

import ChatBox from './chat-box';
import Form from './form';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col items-center">
      <h1 className="font-extrabold text-2xl">AxChat</h1>
      <ChatBox />
      <Form />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Our scaffolding is ready! Now let's add LLM chat functionality to the application.

## API (server)

Next, we'll want to set up an API route to handle the calls to the openAI API. This API receives a JSON object with a `messages` key which contains an array of `MessageType` objects. This type defined by `@axflow/models` will also be used later on the client.

::: warning
It's important to not expose our secrets to the client, which is why we are using the ENV variable pattern and calling it through our server.
:::

```typescript
// app/api/chat/route.ts
import { OpenAIChat } from '@axflow/models/openai/chat';
import { StreamingJsonResponse, type MessageType } from '@axflow/models/shared';

export const runtime = 'edge';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages } = await request.json();

  const stream = await OpenAIChat.streamTokens(
    {
      model: 'gpt-4',
      messages: messages.map((msg: MessageType) => ({ role: msg.role, content: msg.content })),
    },
    {
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
    }
  );

  return new StreamingJsonResponse(stream);
}
```

::: info
Note that we use `gpt-4` model here, but we could use any openAI model, e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
:::

## Client

We'll be using the `useChat` hook from the `@axflow/models` library. We will leverage the following data attributes:

```typescript
const { input, messages, onChange, onSubmit } = useChat();
```

We'll be sending the `messages` to our `ChatBox` component, and the `input, onChange, onSubmit` to our form component.

### ChatBox component

Our chat box will take an array of `MessageType` messages.

```typescript
type MessageType = {
  id: string;
  role: 'user' | 'assistant';
  data?: JSONValueType[];
  content: string;
  created: number;
};
```

Let's modify `ChatBox` to take an array of these messages and display them nicely. We add a little bit of tailwind CSS to make bubbles different depending on who sent them.

```tsx
// app/chat-box.tsx

import type { MessageType } from '@axflow/models/shared';

export default function ChatBox({ messages }: { messages: MessageType[] }) {
  return (
    <div className="w-1/2 h-2/3 flex flex-col gap-2 border border-white rounded p-2 overflow-auto whitespace-pre-line">
      {messages &&
        messages.map((message) => {
          return (
            <div
              key={message.id}
              className={
                message.role === 'user'
                  ? 'self-start text-black bg-white p-2 rounded mr-32'
                  : 'self-end text-black bg-emerald-200 p-2 rounded ml-32'
              }
            >
              {message.content}
            </div>
          );
        })}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Form component

This component has an input box that the application user can interact with to ask questions to the LLM.
It uses the `onSubmit, onChange, input` values that we get back from the `useChat` hook to communicate with the previously defined API.

Here again, we use tailwind for some minimalistic style changes.

```tsx
// app/form.tsx

import React from 'react';

type FormProps = {
  input: string;
  onChange: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
  onSubmit: (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void;
};

export default function Form({ input, onChange, onSubmit }: FormProps) {
  return (
    <div className="w-1/2">
      <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
        <div className="flex gap-4 w-full justify-between">
          <input
            value={input}
            onChange={onChange}
            className="p-4 bg-black border border-white w-full rounded"
            placeholder="Ask the assistant anything"
          />
          <button
            className="px-6 py-2 bg-emerald-300 text-black rounded hover:bg-emerald-400"
            type="submit"
          >
            Send
          </button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Putting it together

Now that we have the `API`, the `ChatBox` component, and the `Form` component, we simply need to hook them all together on our main page, and we're done!

```tsx
// app/page.tsx

'use client';
import { useChat } from '@axflow/models/react';
import ChatBox from './chat-box';
import Form from './form';

export default function Home() {
  const { input, messages, onChange, onSubmit } = useChat({
    url: '/api/chat',
  });
  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col items-center w-screen h-screen gap-4">
      <h1 className="font-extrabold text-4xl pt-4">AxChat</h1>
      <ChatBox messages={messages} />
      <Form input={input} onChange={onChange} onSubmit={onSubmit} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully, that was easy! With `@axflow/models`, streaming data from different LLM APIs is no longer a battle. By the way, you could replace the openAI model that we used in this guide with any other supported model, or integrate your own against our interface.

Soon, using our `@axflow/models` library will also integrate with other tools to get analytics, as well as send LLM requests and their responses to the axeval package for quality monitoring.
