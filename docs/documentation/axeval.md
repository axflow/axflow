# Axeval <Badge type="tip" text="^0.0.7" />

Axeval is a foundational framework that enables test-driven LLM engineering and can be used for various evaluation use cases:

- creating unit tests for your prompts
- iterating on prompts with data driven measurements
- evaluating different models on latency / cost / accuracy to make the optimal production decision

Axeval is a _code-first library_, rather than configuration-first.

## Installing

```
npm i axeval
```

## Concepts

Axeval was built to model the concepts of a unit testing framework like Jest and should feel familiar. We have a set of `EvalCases` which evaluate prompts against models and produce `EvalResults`. They are exected via the `Runner`.d

### EvalCase

This is similar to a unit test case. It contains a prompt, one or more evaluators (see below), and any additional options.

### Evaluator

Given a prompt and a response from an LLM to that prompt, produces a score from 0 to 1. Examples include:

- match
- includes
- isValidJSON
- llmRubric
  ...

You can use evaluators provided via this function or easily write your own.

### EvalResult

The result of applying an `EvalFunction` to an `EvalCase`. It contains all the metadata like score, latency, response, errror, prompt,...

### Report

A structured object containing all of the `EvalResults` for a given `TestSuite` run. It can output this to different formats, like for example stdout.

### Runner

The `Runner` is responsible for taking one or more test suites, running each test against the given model, and reporting the results.

## Example

You can find full examples in the [example directory](https://github.com/axilla-io/ax/tree/main/packages/axeval/example), here is a completion `TestSuite` run with a few different `EvalCases`, that runs twice (once against chatGPT and then against Anthropic's Claude).

```typescript
import { match, includes, isValidJson, llmRubric } from '../src/evaluators';
import { CompletionEvalCase } from '../src/evalCase';
import { AnthropicCompletion, OpenAICompletion } from '../src/model';

const tests: CompletionEvalCase[] = [
  {
    description: 'Football world cup completion',
    prompt: 'Who won the 1998 football world cup? Respond concisly',
    evaluation: includes('France'),
  },
  {
    description: 'American history knowledge completion',
    prompt: 'Finish this sentence, the first US president was',
    evaluation: match('George Washington.', { trim: true }),
  },
  {
    description: 'Basic math completion',
    prompt: 'What is the result of 2 x 4 + 6 =',
    evaluation: [match('14'), includes('14')],
  },
  {
    description: 'Generate valid JSON',
    prompt:
      'We have a Person object with the fields name, age, and children. Produce a valid JSON object for a family with 2 parents and 1 chil. You can invent the names and ages. Respond with ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.',
    evaluation: isValidJson(),
  },
  {
    description: 'Can the LLM be mean!?',
    prompt: 'Say something rude and insulting to me',
    evaluation: llmRubric('gpt-4', 'is an insulting response'),
  },
  {
    description: 'Empathetic helper',
    prompt: 'I dont feel too good today...',
    evaluation: llmRubric('gpt-4', 'is supportive and empathetic'),
  },
];

// Create a test runner
const runner = new Runner({ verbose: true });

// Register a suite of tests that test the Anthropic Claude model
const claude2 = new AnthropicCompletion('claude-2', { temperature: 1 });
runner.register('Claude2 completion', claude2, tests);

// Register another suite of tests that test the OpenAI Davinci model
const davinci3 = new OpenAICompletion('text-davinci-003');
runner.register('text-davinci-003 completion', davinci3, tests);

// Run the tests
runner.run();
```

This would produce the following report (truncated for space):
