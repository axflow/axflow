If you are thinking about making better, or you just want to hack on it, thatâ€™s great!

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to GitLab Repository. Even better you can submit a Merge Request with a fix.

**Working on your first Merge Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series
